# RxJs Remote Client

This is basically RxJs observable over some kind of network connection. It should work over pretty much any long living connection, i've had it working with socket.io and UDP. Observables get cleanup when things go wrong or something disconnects.

Servers files and readme are here https://github.com/maca134/rxjs-remote

Install use `npm install --save @maca134/rxjs-remote-client`
